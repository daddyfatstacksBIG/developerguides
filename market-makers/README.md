# Market Makers

This document contains the necessary resources for partners to implement Keepers
for Market Making.

## Prerequisites

This document assumes familiarity with Ethereum, and in-depth knowledge of the
Maker platform.

## Market Maker Keeper repos

### [Market Maker Keeper](https://github.com/makerdao/market-maker-keeper)

This repository contains a set of Keepers that have been implemented to
facilitate market making on a specific set of decentralized exchanges. While
implemented specifically to work on specific exchanges, all Keepers in the repo
share logic and operate similarly, as they all rely on creating a series of
orders in preconfigured “bands”.

### [Market Maker Stats](https://github.com/makerdao/market-maker-stats)

Market Maker Stats provides a set of tools for visualizing market making data
for a set of decentralized exchanges. These tools include:

- Trade chart tools for showing historical market prices and recent Keeper
  trades.

- Profitability calculation tools for calculating profitability of ETH/DAI or
  BTC/DAI keepers.

- Trade history dumping tools for exporting lists of recent trades.

### [Pymaker](https://github.com/makerdao/pymaker)

Pymaker is a Python API which provides endpoints to interact with the Maker
smart contracts. It exposes most of the functionality of the Maker platform, but
most importantly for this guide it can be used to create Keepers. This library
can be used to create custom market making Keepers.
