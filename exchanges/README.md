# Exchanges

This folder contains guides specifically for exchanges seeking to integrate with
Maker products. This document will outline which Maker products are relevant for
exchanges, and how they can provide value. Furthermore this document will point
to important resources explaining how to integrate with these systems and how
they work.

## Quick start

If you are already familiar with Ethereum, the ERC-20 token standard, and
Solidity smart contracts, you can checkout this guide for listing DAI and MKR
tokens:

## Relevant Maker products for exchanges

The Maker platform consist of various products that are relevant for exchanges.
In this guide we will cover the following products:

- [Dai stablecoin](#dai-stablecoin)
- [Maker token](#maker-token)
- [Maker Protocol](#dai-credit-system)
- [OTC Trading](#otc-trading)
- [Price feeds (Oracles)](#price-feeds)
- [Fiat On-Off Ramps](#fiat-on-off-ramps)

### Dai Stablecoin

One of the main features of the Maker platform is the asset-backed
cryptocurrency called [Dai](https://makerdao.com/) - a cryptocurrency
soft-pegged to the USD at a 1:1 ratio. The Maker system ensures that Dai is
price stable compared to the USD, why it is also known as a “stablecoin”.
Consequently, 1 Dai is equal to 1 USD.

A stablecoin is useful for exchanges as it provides a way for users to hedge
their positions, or exchange more volatile cryptocurrencies to a currency price
stable towards the USD, without having to exchange to fiat currencies.

For users Dai is valuable, as it provides the same features as other
cryptocurrencies, by being easy and cheap to transfer globally, while keeping a
stable price to the USD. This is often useful in countries where fiat currencies
are inflationary. In additon, Dai can earn interest trough the Dai Savings Rate
mechanism of the Maker Protocol.

### Maker token

The
[Maker token (MKR)](https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper/#mkr-token-governance) is
the other token that comprises the Maker platform. The Maker platform is
governed by holders of the MKR tokens, as the tokens are used as
[votes in governance decisions](https://vote.makerdao.com/). The MKR token
[fluctuates in value](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/maker/), why
speculators might seek ways to obtain the token through an exchange. The MKR
token is also needed to pay back fees in the Dai Credit System, why it is
valuable for users of said system to be able to easily access the MKR token.

### The Maker Protocol

The Maker Protocol, is responsible for the issuance of the currency Dai. Dai is
created when users lock up cryptographic assets (tokens) as collateral in the
system, for which they are able to draw a certain percentage of value in Dai as
credit. This is called a Vault position. In the current version, the
collateralization ratio for ETH and BAT is 150 %. This means, that your ratio of
collateral/credit is 150 %, thus you can only draw 66% worth of Dai to your
collateral. This metric ensures that the system is robust in case the collateral
drops in value. If the Vaykt becomes under-collateralized, due to a drop in
collateral value, the position will be liquidated, the collateral seized and
sold off to stabilize the system. In order to control the issuance rate of Dai,
there is a stability fee which a user must pay when loaning Dai. Currently, this
fee is 4 % APR, which is a lot less than traditional loan schemes. Thus, the Dai
Credit System essentially lets users loan money to a very favourable interest
rate by locking up collateral tokens.

You can read much more about the Maker Protocol and the underlying functionality
[here](http://makerdao.com/whitepaper).

The Maker Protocol functionality can be useful for exchanges that are wishing to
create a Vault portal - a way to issue loans with W-ETH or BAT as collateral. It
also enables exchanges an automatic way to create leveraged positions, as this
system can be used to allow users to loan Dai, convert to ETH, use ETH to create
more Dai and so on. However, it can also be valuable for exchanges who have
issued their own tokens, to integrate them as collateral for loans, driving the
value of the underlying token.

Thus, the Maker Protocol can be useful for exchanges, who want to,

- Offer asset-backed loans
- Create leveraged positions
- Provide a collateral type

### OTC Trading

The OTC Trading system allows users to buy and sell ERC-20 tokens on the
Ethereum blockchain. More specifically, it allows users to create buy and sell
orders for DAI, MKR and WETH, allowing for decentralized and automated trade of
these tokens. OTC trading can be useful for exchanges who want to:

- Allow their users direct access to the decentralized exchange service
- Obtain liquidity in certain in MKR or DAI (without creating Vault)

### Price feeds

Maker provides an API for trading prices that can
[be found here](https://developer.makerdao.com/oasis/api/1/). The price feeds
are valuable for exchanges who want to

- Access market prices for MKR and DAI pairs.

### Fiat On-Off Ramps

Fiat on-off ramps are services that exchanges fiat currencies to Dai, bridging
the gap between the fiat and crypto world. Fiat on-off ramps are valuable for
remittance, commerce and for users just seeking to cash out Dai holdings in
local currencies. It is also valuable for users for do not possess crypto, and
want to easily exchange fiat holdings to Dai. Therefore, an on-off ramp partner
can be valuable for exchanges to

- Bridge gap between fiat and crypto, and thus drive adoption and user growth
- Cash out cryptocurrencies

Maker has partnerships with the following on-off ramps for Dai liquidity and
easy Dai to fiat currency conversion, proving a useful resource for remittance
services.
