# Remittance Services

This folder contains guides specifically for remittance services seeking to
integrate with Maker products.

## Prerequisites

This document assumes familiarity with Ethereum, how to integrate ERC-20 tokens,
and basic knowledge of the [Maker platform](https://www.makerdao.com).

## Relevant Maker products for remittance services

The Maker platform consist of various products that are relevant for remittance
services. In this guide we will cover the following products:

- [Dai stablecoin](#dai-stablecoin)
- [Fiat On-Off Ramps](#fiat-on-off-ramps)

### Dai Stablecoin

One of the main features of the Maker Protocol is the asset-backed
cryptocurrency called [Dai](https://makerdao.com/dai) - a cryptocurrency
soft-pegged to the USD at a 1:1 ratio. The Maker system ensures that Dai is
price stable compared to the USD, therefore it is also known as a “stablecoin”.
Consequently, 1 Dai is equal to 1 USD.

For users Dai is valuable, as it provides the same features as other
cryptocurrencies, by being easy and cheap to transfer globally, while keeping a
stable price to the USD. This is often useful in countries where fiat currencies
are inflationary. In the future, users will be able to earn dividends by holding
Dai as an interest rate will be introduced. It also provides an opportunity for
crypto-speculators to hedge their positions. Therefore it can be valuable for
remittance services to integrate Dai, as users are seeking ways to easily
transfer globally, and hold a stable currency.

#### Dai token contract

In order to interact directly with the DAI token, you can find the deployed
smart contract addresses, source code, and ABIs in the links below. The DAI
token follows the
[ERC20 token standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md),
and thus should be interoperable with contracts that implement this standard
interface.

##### Live Dai token smart contract deployments

- Ethereum Mainnet DAI:
  [0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f#code)
- Kovan Testnet DAI:
  [0x4f96fe3b7a6cf9725f59d353f723c1bdb64ca6aa](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x4f96fe3b7a6cf9725f59d353f723c1bdb64ca6aa#code)

##### Listing symbols

When listing DAI in your implementation, you should use the following currency
notations.

A style guide and additional logos can
[be found here](https://www.notion.so/makerdao/Maker-Brand-ac517c82ff9a43089d0db5bb2ee045a4).

### Token libraries

#### Javascript Library

[Dai.js](https://docs.makerdao.com/building-on-top-of-the-maker-protocol/dai.js)
is a javascript library that exposes the functionality of the smart contracts in
a javascript environment, mitigating the need to integrate directly with the
smart contract layer. It can, among other things, be used to
[implement token transfers](https://github.com/makerdao/dai.js#usage).

#### Python API

Similarly to the library above, the
[Python API](https://github.com/makerdao/pymaker) provides endpoints to interact
with the smart contracts in a Python environment, such as
[endpoints for token transfers](https://github.com/makerdao/pymaker#token-transfer).

## Fiat On-Off Ramps

Fiat on-off ramps are services that exchanges fiat currencies to Dai, bridging
the gap between the fiat and crypto world. Fiat on-off ramps are valuable for
remittance, commerce and for users just seeking to cash out Dai holdings in
local currencies. It is also valuable for users, who do not possess crypto, and
want to easily exchange fiat holdings to Dai. Therefore, an on-off ramp partner
can be valuable for wallets to:

- Bridge the gap between fiat and crypto, and thus drive adoption and user
  growth

- Allow users to easily cash out cryptocurrency holdings

Maker has partnerships with the following on-off ramps for Dai liquidity and
easy Dai to fiat currency conversion, proving a useful resource for remittance
services.

- [Wyre](https://www.sendwyre.com/)\
  The [Wyre API](https://www.sendwyre.com/docs/) allows for easy exchange between
  a number of fiat currencies and Dai.\
  Checkout [this guide](/partners/wyre/wyre-guide-01/wyre-guide-01.md) to see
  how to implement their API for cross/border transactions.\
  Not supported in [these countries](https://support.sendwyre.com/security/non-operational-states-in-us-and-countries).
- [Ripio](https://www.ripio.com/en/)\
  Countries: Argentina, Brazil, (Mexico soon) You might need a VPN to access their
  website, if you accessing their service outside South America.
- [Buenbit](https://www.buenbit.com/)\
